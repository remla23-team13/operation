# A2: Operate a Webapp

### Kubernetes: Level 4
- See the ```/charts/templates``` folder for the [Deployment](/charts/templates/model-service.yml), [Service](/charts/templates/model-service.yml) and an [Ingress](/charts/templates/ingress.yml).
- You can also find an example of ConfigMap, Secret, environment variables and volumes in the [```model-service.yml```](/charts/templates/model-service.yml). 
  - To inspect that the volume was mounted correctly first find the pod name <POD>, by using ```kubectl get pods```.
  - Then run ```kubectl exec -it <POD> -- bash```. 
  - You can now inspect the file structure inside the container, you can see that there is a folder volumes containing config.yaml.
- As can be seen in the previous points, we use Helm, see the [```README```](https://github.com/remla23-team13/operation) for technical deployment specifics.

### App Monitoring: Level 2
- We have at least three app-specific metrics.
  - num_requests - The number of requests that have been served
  - positive_prediction_ratio - Ratio of positive predictions over all predictions (per version of the webapp)
  - wrong_prediction_ratio - Ratio of wrong predictions over all predictions (per version of the webapp)
  - review_size - A histogram of the review sizes (characters)

### Grafana: Level 4
