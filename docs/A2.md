# A2: Operate a Webapp
Details on what parts of the assignment rubric have been incorporated into the project. 

### Kubernetes: Level 4
- See the ```/Kubernetes``` folder for the Deployment, Service and an Ingress.
- You can also find an example of ConfigMap and Secret in the ```Kubernetes/model-service.yml```file. 

We completed the Kubernetes rubric. 
See ```\charts\templates``` for the relevant deployment files.
In ```\charts\templates\model-service.yml``` you can find us using Secret, ConfigMap and Volumes.
The volume is just a folder with a python file, to inspect that the volume was mounted correctly first find the pod name <POD>, by using ```kubectl get pods```.
```bash
kubectl exec -it <POD> -- bash
```
You can now inspect the file structure inside the container, you can see that there is a folder volumes with a main.py where the sentiments are switched. 
It is also clear that we are using a Helm configuration.
