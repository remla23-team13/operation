# A4: ML Config Management

#### Project Best Practices: Level 4
- Level 1:
  - Different scripts map to different stages: get data, preprocess, train (see in [model-training](https://github.com/remla23-team13/model-training/tree/main/src)).
  - The project [structure](https://github.com/remla23-team13/model-training) follows cookiecutter recommendations
  - We use pip as a package manager.
  - Clear instruction is provided on how to train the pipeline in the [`README`](https://github.com/remla23-team13/model-training).
- Level 2:
  - Dataset is stored outside the project.
- Level 3:
  - Pip in conjunction with the use of a virtual environment guarantees the same dependencies are installed on different machines.
  - Data feature encoding is a shared component by way of the [lib](https://github.com/remla23-team13/lib/tree/main/src) repository.
  - Mllint is used.
- Level 4:
  - Mllint does not report any issues, and reports are visible when making a PR.
  - There are clear instructions on how to run the pipeline (see [`README`](https://github.com/remla23-team13/model-training)).

#### Pipeline Management: Level 4
- All stages can be run using [`dvc repro`](https://github.com/remla23-team13/model-training), dependencies and outputs are well-defined and metrics are generated.
- Remote storage is [configured](https://github.com/remla23-team13/model-training/blob/main/.dvc/config)
  - Instructions on how to [setup](https://github.com/remla23-team13/model-training) remote storage
  - DVC is used to report metrics and keep track of experiments/models, see [`README`](https://github.com/remla23-team13/model-training).
- Different metrics are reported
  - accuracy = accuracy_score(y, y_pred)
  - precision = precision_score(y, y_pred)
  - recall = recall_score(y, y_pred)
- Instructions are provided, metrics can be displayed across multiple branches and tags. 
- The recall metric goes beyond model correctness.

#### Code Quality: Level 3
- Pylint and DSlinter are configured.
  - Follow the instructions in the [model-training repository](https://github.com/remla23-team13/model-training) to run the tests for yourself.
- Both linters yield a perfect score.
- Linters are executed using the GitHub actions, see [model-training](https://github.com/remla23-team13/model-training/actions) for example. 
  - Configuration decisions are elaborated upon in the report.
