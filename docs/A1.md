#### Release/Versioning: Level 3
- Packages are shared in [package registry](https://github.com/orgs/remla23-team13/packages).
- Artifacts are automatically released using github workflows, see [webapp](https://github.com/remla23-team13/app/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yaml) as an example.

#### Library: Level 4
- Version-aware library [released](https://github.com/orgs/remla23-team13/packages/npm/package/remla-lib) enabling code reuse between applications. 
- Version string is [automatically updated](https://github.com/remla23-team13/lib/blob/main/VersionUtil.js).
- [Library](https://github.com/remla23-team13/lib) contains meaningful date structures or logic.

#### Reliable Model Creation: Level 4
- Refactored enabling replicable model training, model accessible through [public url](https://github.com/remla23-team13/model-training/blob/main/src/get_data.py).
- Project contains [requirements.txt](https://github.com/remla23-team13/model-training/blob/main/requirements.txt).
- Different phases of model creation have been [seperated](https://github.com/remla23-team13/model-training/tree/main/src).

#### Model-Service: Level 4
- Flask server is used and for every tag push an image is created and [published]((https://github.com/orgs/remla23-team13/packages/npm/package/remla-lib). 
- The model can be updated without creating a new image by changing the environment variable in the docker-compose or kubernetes files. 
- Both model-service and model-training use the preprocessing code on lib.
- Swagger is used to generate an API documentation, and we follow Open API Specification, for details see the [```README```](https://github.com/remla23-team13/model-service).

#### App: Level 4
- App has a basic frontend.
- App has an actual use case.
  - Users can give reviews on three different restaurants and view reviews of previous users.
- App contains interactions.
  - Users can indicate whether they agree with the sentiment or not.

#### Operation: Level 4
- Docker compose [file](/docker-compose.yml) is included, with only the webapp accessible from outside
- Example of volume mapping, port mapping and environment variable.
  - To inspect the volume you can use ```docker exec -it <MODEL SERVICE CONTAINER NAME> bash``` to inspect the container files.
- See [```README```](https://github.com/remla23-team13/operation) of this repo for an overview.
