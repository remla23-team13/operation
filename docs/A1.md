# A1: Images & Releases

## Release/Versioning


## Library


## Reliable Model Creation



## Model-Service



## App



## Operation
We include a docker-compose deployment, see the README for explanation of how to deploy.
As suggested by the lecturer the docker-compose setup is still using older versions of the app and model-service images. 
For the most recent version of our project the user should use helm. 
You can see us use a port mapping, and an environment variable.
To see the volume mapping in action you can uncomment this code, and you can see that the sentiment analysis is switched now.
