# A3: Istio Service Mesh

#### Traffic Management: Level 3 (out of 3)
- System defines Gateway, via which it is accessible, and VirtualService (see [`istio.yml`](/istio/istio.yml)).
- Uses DestinationRules ([example](/istio/model-service.yml)) and [weights](/istio/istio.yml) to enable custom routing.
- Repeated requests from the same origin have a stable routing by using cookies, which are set in the [`istio/istio.yml`](/istio/istio.yml).

#### Continuous Experimentation: Level 4
- As detailed in the rubric for [App Monitoring](/docs/A2.md#app-monitoring-level-2), to access prometheus run `istioctl dashboard prometheus`.
- The system deploys two version each with a different background colour for the review page. See the [`README`](https://github.com/remla23-team13/operation) for details on how to inspect this behaviour.
- See the essay.

#### Additional Use Case: Level 4
- We implemented the rate-limit use case, which is fully working. If a user makes more than 10 requests within one they will be redirected to a 404 page.
