# Operation
This repo contains the deployment files for Docker Compose &amp; (later) Kubernetes. 
The repo uses the images generated by other projects in the organisation to create interacting Docker containers. 
For now the only containers started are those for the [app](https://github.com/remla23-team13/app) and the [model-service][https://github.com/remla23-team13/model-service]. 
The app serves a website where one can enter some text to see whether it has a positive or negative sentiment. 
This is accomplished via a REST request to the model-service. 
There is also already scaffolding in-place for the app to make use of a library, which is located at [lib](https://github.com/remla23-team13/lib). 
Finally there is the [model-training](https://github.com/remla23-team13/model-training) repository which will take care of the model training later.
