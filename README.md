# Operation
This repo contains all the files necessary to run the restaurant review assessment [application](https://github.com/remla23-team13/app).  
The app serves a website where one can enter some text to see whether it has a positive or negative sentiment.
The repo uses the images generated by other projects in the organisation, namely [model-service](https://github.com/remla23-team13/model-service).
There is also already scaffolding in-place for the app to make use of a library, which is located at [lib](https://github.com/remla23-team13/lib).
This is accomplished via a REST request to the model-service. 
Finally, there is the [model-training](https://github.com/remla23-team13/model-training) repository which will take care of the model training later.

The code base can be tested in different ways, with the Helm version having the most up-to-date code. 
It is also possible to only use Kubernetes or even only Docker-compose, both of these set-ups make use of older images, however. 
For the exact steps see the set-up guide. 

Once the webapp is accessible you can enter a sentence or word and the application will return the sentiment.
Important note: good is actually classified as having a negative sentiment, try great instead. 


## Set-up guide
#### Prerequisites
- Minikube v1.30
  - Docker driver is used
  - Ingress is enabled: ```minikube addons enable ingress```
- Helm v3.11
- Docker v20.10
- Docker Compose v2.4

First clone the project:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:remla23-team13/operation.git
cd operation
```

## Helm

Make sure dependencies are installed:
```bash
helm dependency update ./charts
```

Install the services using helm:
```bash
helm install <RELEASE_NAME> ./charts
```
The `RELEASE_NAME` variable can be any string.

To access the application via the browser:
- MacOS: run ```minikube tunnel```. Leave that terminal window open, you can now access the app on localhost.
- Otherwise: run minikube service list. And use the URL of the ingress-nginx-controller.

To access the different endpoints use: 
- Webapp: ```http://localhost```
- Prometheus: ```http://localhost/prometheus/graph```
- Grafana: ```http://localhost/grafana```

For Grafana you can use the following default login credentials:
- user: admin
- password: prom-operator

To stop Helm use:
```bash
helm uninstall <RELEASE_NAME>
```

### Kubernetes

Then run the following commands:
```bash
minikube start
minikube addons enable ingress
./deploy_kub.sh
```
Use ```kubectl get pods``` to verify that all pods have started.
To access the application via the browser:
- MacOS: run ```minikube tunnel```. Leave that terminal window open, you can now access the app on localhost.
- Otherwise: run minikube service list. And use the URL of the ingress-nginx-controller. 

You can use ```./delete_kub.sh``` to stop all kubernetes resources and ```stop Minikube``` to stop the cluster.
If you were wondering why we our model-service has been added to the ingress, this has to do with how React handles requests.

### Docker-Compose
Run the following commands in the root directory of this repo
```bash
docker compose up
```

To stop the containers use ```docker compose down```.
